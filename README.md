# Rackspace Coding Challenge

## Project requirements:
As a user, I would like to have an application that shows a table of information. When the user loads the page, they should see a table presented. The application should return data from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. When the user clicks on the header of a table column, it should sort the table.
We will be looking for

1. Best practices using your chosen framework

Things that you can do to WOW us:

1. Stylistic flair
2. Unit testing
